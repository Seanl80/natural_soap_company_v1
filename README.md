# Natural Soap Company

[Link to Natural Soap Co. live site](https://natural-soap-company-v1-33f8559d9f2f.herokuapp.com/)

This is my Milestone 4 project based around a fictional company.
The Natural Soap Company is a newly formed company with the aim of selling soaps free from harmful chemicals to customers of all ages who think like us on how soap should be made. It's website has been created using a postgreSQL database. It's made using lanuages like JavaScript and Python. Bootstrap has been used for a structured layout and Stripe used for payments.

## Developer goals

As a Developer, I would like:
- to build a website which is easy to navigate through and use.
- to make the user able to have their own profile for when they use the website.
- to allow users the ability to create, display, edit and delete reviews.
- develop a database structure which will allow for previous orders, wishlists, delivery info to be stored securely.
- for superusers to be able to create, display, edit and delete products to sell.

## User stories

As a user of this website, I want:
- to browse products easily without the need to sign in.
- to add items to my cart to see how much everything I wanted would cost.
- to be able to read reviews on the products before I buy them.
- to feel that your website is secure.
- the sign up process to be easy to understand.
- acknowledgement that I have made an account with you.
- the buying process to be quick and straight forward.
- acknowledgement that I have made a purchase from you.
- to be able to view my past orders.
- to be able to ammend my details if needed.
- to be able to make a list of items I would like to buy in the future.

## Design choices

- The basic colour range for this website are with the following colours :-
- ![#ffffff](https://placehold.co/15x15/ffffff/ffffff.png) `#ffffff`
- ![#000000](https://placehold.co/15x15/000000/000000.png) `#000000`
- ![#6c757d](https://placehold.co/15x15/6c757d/6c757d.png) `#6c757d`
- ![#ff007b](https://placehold.co/15x15/ff007b/ff007b.png) `#ff007b`
- ![#01013e](https://placehold.co/15x15/01013e/01013e.png) `#01013e`



I felt these were a vibrant contrast to my beige background picture.
Originally I had my home page background picture displayed throughout the website but, especially with the pages that had images, I felt this clashed with my content so decided to go for a dark plain colour so I could let my content stand out more cleanly. 
I felt the rounded edges of the buttons and lowercase within the buttons felt more relaxed like the products.

## Wireframes

[Wireframes](https://github.com/Seanl80/natural_soap_company_v1/blob/main/docs/wireframes/All-wireframes.pdf)

Here are the original wireframes:
I have made the nine main pages of the site.
- Home page consists of an explanation of the site with navigation and shop now button. There will be icons in the navbar to login/register and a basket total.
- The Products page will consist of rectangler cards showing the different products with their images and prices.
- The Product details page will show a larger image and a more in depth description with a review section below.
- The Wishlist page will show rectangular cards again with image and price with buttons to remove from wishlist or go to product details page.
- The Basket page will contain a large image, product info and clear pricing and a total. There is buttons to make a choice whether to buy and go to checkout or to continue shopping.
- The Checkout page will be a similar layout to the basket page but will ask for customer details and a permission check to store this info.
- The Checkout success page will consist of an order confirmation the order was successful stating what was bought.
- The Register page will be the base for all form pages with content being centered with white input boxes clearly labelled.
- The Sign in page will be the base for my sign out page to keep things consistent again with clearly labelled white input boxes.

## Testing Developer Goals

As a Developer, I would like:
1. to build a website which is easy to navigate through and use.
- I feel I achieved this by firstly having the big show now will leads directly to all products. The different categories are highlighted on hover and each product and page have clear navigation routes forwards and back.
2. to make the user able to have their own profile for when they use the website.
- I felt I wanted first time customers to be able to wander and navigate through the website without the pressure of having to make an account. The account icon stands out in the navbar with a simple process of creating an account. Users then experience the benefit of creating an accountas they can create a personal wishlist and have details saved when buying products for quicker checkout in the future.
3. to allow users the ability to create, display, edit and delete reviews.
- users when signed in can create, edit or delete their reviews they made on all products. Only superusers have the ability to edit or delete evry review made.
4. develop a database structure which will allow for previous orders, wishlists, delivery info to be stored securely.
- if a customer has signed in then this can be achieved by selecting the Account icon then My Profile for delivery info and past orders. Selecting the Account icon then Wishlist will allow customer to create and view a list of products they maybe interested in purchasing in the future.
5. for superusers to be able to create, display, edit and delete products to sell.
- this has been achieved as superusers have the ability to edit or delete all reviews as well as creating there own.

## Testing

I have used these validators to check the validity of my code.

- [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

- [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/)

- [JShint JavaScript Validation](https://jshint.com/)
