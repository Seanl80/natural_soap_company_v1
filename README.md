This is my Milestone 4 project based around a fictional company.
The Natural Soap Company is a newly formed company with the aim of selling soaps free from harmful chemicals to customers of all ages who think like us on how soap should be made. It's website has been created using a postgreSQL database. It's made using lanuages like JavaScript and Python. Bootstrap has been used for a structured layout and Stripe used for payments.

## Developer goals

As a Developer, I would like:
- to build a website which is easy to navigate through and use.
- to make the user able to have their own profile for when they use the website.
- to allow users the ability to create, display, edit and delete reviews.
- develop a database structure which will allow for previous orders, wishlists, delivery info to be stored securely.
- for superusers to be able to create, display, edit and delete products to sell.

## User stories

As a user of this website, I want:
- to browse products easily without the need to sign in.
- to add items to my cart to see how much everything I wanted would cost.
- to be able to read reviews on the products before I buy them.
- to feel that your website is secure.
- the sign up process to be easy to understand.
- acknowledgement that I have made an account with you.
- the buying process to be quick and straight forward.
- acknowledgement that I have made a purchase from you.
- to be able to view my past orders.
- to be able to ammend my details if needed.
- to be able to make a list of items I would like to buy in the future.

## Design choices

The basic colour range for this website are with the following colours :

- ![#ffffff](https://placehold.co/15x15/ffffff/ffffff.png) `#ffffff`
- ![#000000](https://placehold.co/15x15/000000/000000.png) `#000000`
- ![#6c757d](https://placehold.co/15x15/6c757d/6c757d.png) `#6c757d`
- ![#ff007b](https://placehold.co/15x15/ff007b/ff007b.png) `#ff007b`
- ![#01013e](https://placehold.co/15x15/01013e/01013e.png) `#01013e`



I felt these were a vibrant contrast to my beige background picture.
Originally I had my home page background picture displayed throughout the website but, especially with the pages that had images, I felt this clashed with my content so decided to go for a dark plain colour so I could let my content stand out more cleanly. 
I felt the rounded edges of the buttons and lowercase within the buttons felt more relaxed like the products.
The toasts I kept a white background on so they would stand out as I have a timer for how long they appear for.

## Wireframes

[Wireframes](https://github.com/Seanl80/natural_soap_company_v1/blob/main/docs/wireframes/All-wireframes.pdf)

Here are the original wireframes:
I have made the nine main pages of the site.
- The <strong>Home page</strong> consists of an explanation of the site with navigation and shop now button. There will be icons in the navbar to <strong>login/register</strong> and a basket total.
- The <strong>Products page</strong> will consist of rectangler cards showing the different products with their images and prices.
- The <strong>Product details</strong> page will show a larger image and a more in depth description with a review section below.
- The <strong>Wishlist page</strong> will show rectangular cards again with image and price with buttons to remove from wishlist or go to product details page.
- The <strong>Basket page</strong> will contain a large image, product info and clear pricing and a total. There is buttons to make a choice whether to buy and go to checkout or to continue shopping.
- The <strong>Checkout page</strong> will be a similar layout to the basket page but will ask for customer details and a permission check to store this info.
- The <strong>Checkout success page</strong> will consist of an order confirmation the order was successful stating what was bought.
- The <strong>Register page</strong> will be the base for all form pages with content being centered with white input boxes clearly labelled.
- The <strong>Sign in page</strong> will be the base for my sign out page to keep things consistent again with clearly labelled white input boxes.

## Testing Developer Goals

As a Developer, I would like:
1. to build a website which is easy to navigate through and use.
- I feel I achieved this by firstly having the big show now will leads directly to all products. The different categories are highlighted on hover and each product and page have clear navigation routes forwards and back.
2. to make the user able to have their own profile for when they use the website.
- I felt I wanted first time customers to be able to wander and navigate through the website without the pressure of having to make an account. The account icon stands out in the navbar with a simple process of creating an account. Users then experience the benefit of creating an accountas they can create a personal wishlist and have details saved when buying products for quicker checkout in the future.
3. to allow users the ability to create, display, edit and delete reviews.
- users when signed in can create, edit or delete their reviews they made on all products. Only superusers have the ability to edit or delete evry review made.
4. develop a database structure which will allow for previous orders, wishlists, delivery info to be stored securely.
- if a customer has signed in then this can be achieved by selecting the Account icon then My Profile for delivery info and past orders. Selecting the Account icon then Wishlist will allow customer to create and view a list of products they maybe interested in purchasing in the future.
5. for superusers to be able to create, display, edit and delete products to sell.
- this has been achieved as superusers have the ability to edit or delete all reviews as well as creating there own.

## Testing User Stories

As a user of this website, I want:
1. to browse products easily without the need to sign in.
- from the home page you can jump straight into view products either from the shop now button or choosing a category.
![Viewing products](docs/images/view-products.png)
2. to add items to my cart to see how much everything I wanted would cost.
- the cart structure is easy to understand and see how much your grand total would be.
![Cart order price](docs/images/checkout-price.png)
3. to be able to read reviews on the products before I buy them.
- on each product detail page a review section has been added to allow users to read reviews before buying them with or without signing in.
![Reviews](docs/images/reviews.png)
4. to feel that your website is secure.
- on my toast pop up and the checkout screen I felt it was important to use the word secure to put users at ease of potential fears.
![Secure toast message](docs/images/secure-ch-1.png)
![Secure checkout](docs/images/secure-ch-2.png)
5. the sign up process to be easy to understand.
- everything here is labelled and navigation clear to understand. If corrections are needed its stated clearly.
![Sign up](docs/images/sign-up.png)
![Sign up corrections](docs/images/sign-up-corrections.png)
6. acknowledgement that I have made an account with you.
- users will recieve a confirmation email after a sign up which will require user to verify their email by clicking the provided link.
![Verify email](docs/images/verify-email.png)
![Confirm sign up](docs/images/sign-up-confirm.png)
7. the buying process to be quick and straight forward.
- after viewing the cart its just a case of filling out details (if you are a new user) if not details can be saved and boxes prepopulated. Then it is one more button click for the purchase. You can also click directly from the toast pop up but it points to the cart icon if you don't click on the toast button this is again to aid with navigation.
![Toast checkout](docs/images/buy-process1.png)
![Cart checkout](docs/images/buy-process2.png)
8. acknowledgement that I have made a purchase from you.
- there is two confirmations. Firstly on screen you will see an order confirmation stating what you have bought and the price you have been charged. Then secondly customer will recieve an email with the same info of what has been bought and how much was paid.
![Order confirmation](docs/images/order-confirm.png)
![Email confirmation](docs/images/order-confirm-email.png)
9. to be able to ammend my details and to be able to view my past orders.
- thi can be done easily from the My Profile screen where details are stored and past orders are listed and can be clicked to view full details.
![Ammending details and Past orders](docs/images/edit-past-orders.png)
10. to be able to make a list of items I would like to buy in the future.
- the wishlist is a great way for product short cuts and to keep potential buys in a personal space for future use.

## Bugs

I did stumble into a few problems of my own doing most of the time. These didn't really come to light until I started to test the responsiveness of the site. For example the navbar responsiveness was great until 420 width then the alignment all went out. I added a media query to fix this and to lessen my hero text top padding for better visual effect. I also found my quantity box in my product details was affected to because of the layout so another media query was added for that.
I also found that when my bag was empty the footer was jumping inside my div that contained the text. So I had to change the position to fixed from static to fix that.
![Jumping Footer](docs/images/footer-bug)
However this meant on smaller screen some of my bottom content could not be seen so padding had to be added. After creating the product pages I felt having the home page background was too much so I went for a plain color to help the content stand but because of the design of the picture I could't see that I had put the image inside the body and overlay. This was overcome by removing it from the body and renaming the overlay class on my homepage to include the picture rather than going through all my pages to remove the overlay.
