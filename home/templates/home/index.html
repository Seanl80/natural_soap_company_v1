                        Did you know that soap making has been around forever! Evidence has been found that ancient Babylonians 
                        understood soap making as early as 2800 BC. Everyone from the Egyptians to the Romans and all the way to 
                        us now have used soap.

                        As the best UK supplier of natural soaps, we aim to always have soaps that will be kinder and gentler on 
                        your body to avoid irritations and leave your body feeling smooth, soft, and well-nourished. You won't 
                        find any nasty chemicals in our soaps; they are made with 100% natural origin ingredients and free from 
                        things like parabens and SLS, which are known to cause irritation.
